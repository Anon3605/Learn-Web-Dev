    Hello this is a normal text with no design
    <p>
        This is a paragraph tag quote which is for example. next paragraph include lorem texts
    </p>

    <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Beatae iure libero animi delectus dicta maxime consequatur aspernatur quos, voluptas tenetur ducimus cum voluptate, quo, aperiam sed unde dolorem culpa magni.
    </p>

    This is not in paragraph tag, now we used enter.

    This is another text not under paragraph tag.

    So you can see the paragraph tag used to make different paragraph.

    <p>
        Here is a paragraph that contains two other tags that are called "bold" and "strong". in the next paragraph we are using bold and strong tags.
    </p>

    <p>
        This 
        <b>
            "Hello"
        </b> 
        is used by bold tag or b,/b and this 
        <strong>
            "Hello"
        </strong> i
        s used by strong tag or strong,/strong
    </p>

    <p>
        The main difference between these two tag is that the strong tag semantically emphasizes on the important word or section of words while the bold tag is just offset text conventionally styled in bold. maily strong is a semantic tag and bold is not. Strong is meaningful word and bold is just bold
    </p>

    <p>
        Now 
        <small>
            "Hello my Beautiful Wolrd"
        </small> 
        world is used in small tag or small,/small
    </p>


    <p>
        This word 
        <i>
            "Hello my Beautiful Wife"
        </i>
        is used in italic tag i,/i
    </p>

    <p>
        Simple as that, thank you<3
    </p>
