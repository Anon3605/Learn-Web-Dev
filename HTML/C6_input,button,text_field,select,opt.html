    <h1>HTML Forms: Input Types, Buttons And Text Field, Select, Option</h1>

    <p>
        There many boxes you may see in websites and those are for username, passwords, email and dates and others. to use the input field we use input tag which has no closing tag at all. These tags are called <strong>empty</strong> tags. The attributes that is type. <br>
        There are 5 types of inputs and those are:
        <ol>
            <li>Text</li>
            <li>Password</li>
            <li>Number</li>
            <li>Checkbox</li>
            <li>Date</li>
        </ol>
        You just need to write the name of the type in snmaller case in the type area in the input, there also a property that called <strong>placeholder</strong> and that is why you can see faded text on the input below.
