    <h1>
        Image Tag With Attributes Display Online Image, Local Image, Folder Image
    </h1>
    <p>Here comes the image tag that is also known as img,/img.But there are 3 ways to include... </p>
    <p>They are ....</p>
    <p>1.Just Image</p>
    <p>2.Folder/Local image</p>
    <p>3.Online image</p>

    <h3>1.img</h3>

    <p>To use just image we need to have a image in the same folder as the HTML file is included. in that case we need to use an attribute called <strong>Source</strong> which will contain the <strong>value</strong> as name of the image. For example there is an image that is named <strong>HTML_C4</strong></p>

    <img src="HTML_C4.jpg" alt="This is the HTML_C4 image">

    <p>As you can see the image is using just image tag and you must be wondering what the heck is the <i>alt</i> attribute, this one is used to give a text about what the image is about... It works if the page is loading about...</p>

    <h3>2.Folder/Local img</h3>
    <p>Here comes the local aka folder image. it's just like the same as the normal image but the main difference is that the image maintain the absolute location of where it is put... If you wanna know how? Just get in the file manager and see if there is any title named <strong>quick access</strong> and wait, wait, wait... if you just click it then the wait was just for you. first go in a folder that you like. now clock at the bar where the <strong>quick access</strong> was and now what you see is called the absolute location of an object/file/application whatever... if you see the source code that you can see that the source is given by <strong>"Image Folder/HTML_C4.png</strong>.</p>

    <img src="Image Folder/HTML_C4.png" alt="">

    <h3>3.Online img</h3>
    <p>Just go in the google and search any photo that you like except restricted one(pleaaaseee). Just right click and select copy image address and then paste it in the source portion to finish the lesson. </p>

    <p>Tbh, this process is very effective in the commercial website designing</p>
    <!-- yeap! Don't tell me why, cause I know -->
